# Title to use for the report.
title: Jovian quality control metrics

# How to plot graphs. Different templates can override these settings, but
# the default template can use interactive plots (Javascript using HighCharts)
# or flat plots (images, using MatPlotLib). With interactive plots, the report
# can prevent automatically rendering all graphs if there are lots of samples
# to prevent the browser being locked up when the report opens.
plots_force_flat: False # Try to use only flat image graphs
plots_force_interactive: False # Try to use only interactive javascript graphs
plots_flat_numseries: 250 # If neither of the above, use flat if > this number of datasets
num_datasets_plot_limit: 50 # If interactive, don't plot on load if > this number of datasets
max_table_rows: 1500 # Swap tables for a beeswarm plot above this

extra_fn_clean_trim: # MultiQC also imports the log of HuGo alignment, this log file has the rule name in it, this needs to be removed, this can be done as follows... Source: https://multiqc.info/docs/#sample-name-cleaning
