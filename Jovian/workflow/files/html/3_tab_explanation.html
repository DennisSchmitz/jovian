        <li> Pick a sample to open the Interactive Genome Viewer </li>
        <li> The first "Node" within a sample is automatically loaded, you can view a specific node (scaffold) with the dropdown menu. The scaffolds are ordered from large to small. </li>
        <li> Be aware that loading might take a very long time depending on the size of the scaffold. This usually is a non-issue for scaffolds smaller than 28k nucleotides.
